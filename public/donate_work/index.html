    ImHex is a featureful Free and Open Source Hex Editor under the GPLv2 License. However, while free means you can download it for free and modify it to your hearts content, it does mean it's free to develop.
    Developing Open Source software is a huge time investment of mainly volunteers that do this in their free time. We of couse still have infrastructure and hardware costs to keep ImHex running and free for all.
    <br/><br/>
    For these reasons we'd <strong>highly</strong> appreciate your support. If ImHex provides a benefit to you, your co-workers or your employees, consider sponsoring us so we can keep doing what we love: Developing free Software!
    <br/><br/><br/><br/>
    Of course there's also benefits for doing this depending on your level of sponsorship!

        <li>You get priority when requesting features</li>
        <li>You can get your internal file formats turned into Patterns</li>
        <li>If you have special needs, you can have a custom Plugin made for you</li>
        <li>You get a warm feeling in your heart for making a difference :)</li>
    </ul>
    <br/><br/>
